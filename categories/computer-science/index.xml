      <description>There are plenty of concepts related to computer science in video production actually which are so confusing for one want to get into the field of shooting higher quality of video. So in this blog. I will introduce some researches that I have done on these concepts from the perspective of a software engineer. Hopefully I can explain them clearly and get the chance to talk about how I get inspired to apply storing data in database by the way data get stored in video.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been using gerrit as a version control tool. I was taking it for granted that gerrit is some sort of github. But unfortunately, it is not. Gerrit has its own logical way of managing the version. One example is git push.
In github, I use git push origin &amp;lt;branch_name&amp;gt; for push changes to the remote repo where the branch_name is just simply the same name as remote like master or dev.</description>
